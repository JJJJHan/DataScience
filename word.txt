Aÿtext fileÿ(sometimes spelledÿtextfile; an old alternative name isÿflatfile) is a kind ofÿcomputer fileÿthat is structured as a sequence ofÿlinesÿofÿelectronic text. A text file existsÿstored as dataÿwithin aÿcomputer file system. In operating systems such asÿCP/MÿandÿMS-DOS, where the operating system does not keep track of the file size in bytes, the end of a text file is denoted by placing one or more special characters, known as anÿend-of-fileÿmarker, as padding after the last line in a text file. On modern operating systems such asÿMicrosoft WindowsÿandÿUnix-likeÿsystems, text files do not contain any special EOF character, because file systems on those operating systems keep track of the file size in bytes. Most text files need to haveÿend-of-lineÿdelimiters, which are done in a few different ways depending on operating system. Some operating systems withÿrecord-orientated file systemsÿmay not use new line delimiters and will primarily store text files with lines separated as fixed or variable length records.
"Text file" refers to a type of container, whileÿplain textÿrefers to a type of content.
